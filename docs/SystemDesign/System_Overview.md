## Features of Breadmin
### Production Scheduling
Production Scheduling is the main feature of Breadmin. The production scheduler produces a Gantt Chart and list of timed activities in order to product the products inputed. It schedules blocks of time using the bakery configuration, product prep-time and bake time, and the orders that are inputted by the user. When an order is inputted, the scheduler suggests blocks of time available to complete the order in the required time frame.

### Analytics
Analytics is the subsidiary feature of Breadmin. The analytics are generated using data from previous orders and previous production schedules. They are then displayed to the user on the analytics page in table and chart form.
