1. Business Problem Statement
  - What needs to be solved or improved
    - Customers Place orders for large number of different goods. Many of these products have different multiple stages of development. The goal of the software is to allow the management to coordinate order with different stage times as well as allow producers to coordinate and initiate those production stages at the right time.
2. Current Business Process
  - How does the business currently work?
    - A receptionist makes use of paper chits to write orders of product that are called in. The stages are currently coordinated between a production manager and the relevant production team members.
  - What is good about this process
    - Easy for the receptionist to make orders
    - Certain fluidity that is comfortable
  - What is bad about this process
    - Has very little in the way of error correction. Customers occasionally change orders mid-production
    - There is no change log of what happens to an order and people can verbally make changes and not commuicate them
    - There are many locations of the business. They aren't able to communicate orders very well (or changes in orders)
    - Current disorganization in system used is a large time suck. 
3. Scope and Limitations
  - What is expected from the software
    - If a manager places an order, production gets the notification in the appropriate time-frame to begin production
    - Filter processes by day and merge like process in orders (all beans are soaked at the same time)
    - To allow the manager to perform rudimentary analytics on the week
      - To see ingredient consumption to know what to order
  - What cannot be altered about the current process
    - Needs some sort of "offline" capability for production to essentially check of a list 
    - needs capability to print off production list
  - What limitations should we set on ourselves as Developers
    - Scheduler is the most important need. Anything else is bells and whistles
4. Key Business Objectives
  - What does the business want to acheive with this project (what is the ultimate business objective)
    - Securing exact orders
    - Timely Delivery of ordered product
    - Collaboration between all members of the odering process (could be as simple as a shared notes box [or individual for extra fun])
    - Taking cognitive load off of the producers for their work day
5. Project Completion Criteria
  - What items can we agree on (and approve) that deem the project completed successfully
    - The production of a order coordinator/scheduler
6. Risks
  - What are the risk factors of this project
    - Business may what to organize team differently and my not want a rigid option
    - Designing with to few users in mind
    - Timing may be a larger constraint on delivery than originally planned
7. Assumptions
  - These should be added as interviews and analysis continue
